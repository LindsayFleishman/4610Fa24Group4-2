**Description of Dataset**

We received our data from catalog.data.gov. This dataset is specifically obtained from Montgomery County of Maryland, and is the data for Crash Reporting. It provides information on drivers involved in traffic collisions. 

**Generated Questions & Their Importance**

Question #1: Which vehicle make/model would be most susceptible to crashing in rainy conditions?

Importance: Understanding the type of car can help companies see if they need to recall their vehicles. This can also drivers pick a car if they know the climate of the region they live in. Thus, this question is important for both the buyer and the seller of cars, as well as pin pointing potential reasons why crashes in rain occur.


Question #2: Based on post-Covid monthly statistics, what is the forecast for the amount of crashes per month and the change in average speed limit?

Importance: Due to Covid-19, there was a drop in the amount of vehicles on the road. To ensure that this would not skew our forecasted data, we excluded all statistics from before the pandemic. It is important to see what months contain the most crashes so that drivers can avoid collisions and law enforcement knows what to expect each month. The change in average speed limit is important to note so that it can potentially be changed to eliminate future crashes or so that law enforcement knows what speeds to monitor.

**Manipulations Applied**


Excluding and filtering out extraneous data (ex: Longitude, Latitude)

Modifying the data for spelling mistakes and uniformity (ex: Vehicle Make misspelled)

This resulted in the data being more **organized**, **readable** and **valid**.

**Analysis and Results**

We analyzed it post-Covid as there was a big drop due to less cars on the road, and we did not want this to impact the forecasting as it would be included and impact the future data. Our analysis worked best with linear regression as it showed the dips and peaks to crashes that were reported throughout the year; this also helped with forecasting in the future. It was interesting to note how the peak amount of crashes were at the end of the year between November and December, which can correlate to holiday season and potential driving under the influence, as well as more people on the road due to travel season. Another important aspect of the linechart is the pattern of February being the month every year with the least amount of crashes. Since this dataset is from Maryland, it makes sense that February the number of crashes reported drops as February in Maryland is the worst weather conditions with blizzards. This leads to less people on the road, as well as minimal traveling with no holidays in that month, and less crashes occurring.
