**Description of Dataset**

We received our data from catalog.data.gov. This dataset is specifically obtained from Montgomery County of Maryland, and is the data for Crash Reporting. It provides information on drivers involved in traffic collisions. 

**Generated Questions & Their Importance**

Question #1: Which vehicle make/model would be most susceptible to crashing in rainy conditions?

Importance: Understanding the type of car can help companies see if they need to recall their vehicles. This can also drivers pick a car if they know the climate of the region they live in. Thus, this question is important for both the buyer and the seller of cars, as well as pin pointing potential reasons why crashes in rain occur.


Question #2: Post-Covid - Forecasting for 2025 and 2026, what will the count of crashes be (monthly) and the change in average speed limit? 

Importance: This question helps us to contextualize crashes and why there may be spikes at certain times of the year. Forecasting for the future can also prepare the officers for what to expect on certain dates. 

**Manipulations Applied**

We used Data Interpretor in Tableau to clean out text file workbook. 

**Analysis and Results**

**Question 1**

**Question 2**

We analyzed it post-Covid as there was a big drop due to less cars on the road, and we did not want this to impact the forecasting as it would be included and impact the future data.
