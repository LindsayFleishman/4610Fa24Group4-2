**Description of Dataset**

We received our data from catalog.data.gov. This dataset is specifically obtained from Montgomery County of Maryland, and is the data for Crash Reporting. It provides information on drivers involved in traffic collisions. 

**Generated Questions & Their Importance**

Question #1: Which vehicle make/model would be most susceptible to crashing in rainy conditions?

Importance: Understanding the type of car can help companies see if they need to recall their vehicles. This can also drivers pick a car if they know the climate of the region they live in. Thus, this question is important for both the buyer and the seller of cars, as well as pin pointing potential reasons why crashes in rain occur.


Question #2: Based on post-Covid monthly statistics, what is the forecast for the amount of crashes per month and the change in average speed limit?

Importance: Due to Covid-19, there was a drop in the amount of vehicles on the road. To ensure that this would not skew our forecasted data, we excluded all statistics from before the pandemic. It is important to see what months contain the most crashes so that drivers can avoid collisions and law enforcement knows what to expect each month. The change in average speed limit is important to note so that it can potentially be changed to eliminate future crashes or so that law enforcement knows what speeds to monitor.

**Manipulations Applied**

We used Data Interpretor in Tableau to clean out text file workbook.

We analyzed it post-Covid as there was a big drop due to less cars on the road, and we did not want this to impact the forecasting as it would be included and impact the future data.
