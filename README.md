**Description of Dataset**

We received our data from catalog.data.gov. This dataset is specifically obtained from Montgomery County of Maryland, and is the data for Crash Reporting. It provides information on drivers involved in traffic collisions. 

**Generated Questions & Their Importance**

Question #1: Which vehicle make/model would be most susceptible to crashing in rainy conditions?

Importance: Understanding the type of car can help companies see if they need to recall their vehicles. This can also drivers pick a car if they know the climate of the region they live in. Thus, this question is important for both the buyer and the seller of cars, as well as pin pointing potential reasons why crashes in rain occur.


Question #2: Forecasting crashes based off date, what time of the year in the future has the most crashes?

Importance: This question helps understand why crashes may happen, for example if more crashes happen around the holiday season when people can be celebrating and driving under the influence. This can inform drivers and officers when more people may be on the roads when they shouldn't be so they can avoid and eliminate more crashes. Forecasting for the future can also prepare the officers for what to expect on certain dates. 

**Manipulations Applied**

We used Data Interpretor in Tableau to clean out text file workbook.
